# vertx-starter

This is a simple online generator for vert.x projects

The whole SPA is data driven, build tools can be added to the file [buildtools.json](buildtools.json).

Components can be added to the file [components.json](components.json)

The generated project comes from the handlebars templates under `templ` for each build tools there should be a folder. In this folder all files will be handled as handlebars templates.
